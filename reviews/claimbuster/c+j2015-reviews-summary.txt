1. Comparison with Janyce Weibe's work, 'subjectivity analysis'. How different our work is?

2. What's AlchemyAPI? What's the training data used for their sentiment analyzer? In my experience, sentiment is heavily domain-dependent.

3. Which features are important and which are not important? Why length is important?

Reviewer 3

1. Overall, the introduction and motivation in the paper is too long. Provide more details on the approach / system.
