Tableview comments:
 
To do for camera ready:
 
1. Change the title to tableview and inform the chair.
 
2.Entire paragraphs of this paper are copied verbatim from authors’ previous work published in last year’s ICDE. This includes complete sections on scoring measures and algorithms (which were most interesting to me). This is self-plagiarism, and it is not acceptable.
 
3.The demonstration scenarios are very limited determining that the audience should select a particular value for the key and non-key attributes. The authors should take under serious consideration to let the audience to experiment freely with the parameters of the system. {We should mention that these are just examples and the users are able to change different input parameters and generate their own previews.}
 
4.The authors should include in the introduction section brief, intuitive descriptions elaborating on how the key attributes and the sample entries of the preview tables are selected.
 
5.In Section I, authors should clarify how to define the term "entity graphs".
 
 
To do for the demo:
 
Adding representative sample tuples in the preview tables. 
 
Low priority comments:
 
I am not convinced in using tables to preview graphs. The whole point of having graphs is to emphasize connections between entities, which are implicit in tabular representation. It is not clear how connections are explored in the proposed system.
 
The demonstration should clearly show that proposed approach is superior to more graph-centric summarization and clustering approaches. Comparison with single summarization algorithm is not sufficient.
 
Moreover, loading a second dataset (and not only Freebase) would also be very interesting.
