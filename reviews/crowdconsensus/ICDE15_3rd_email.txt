Dear Mohamed and PC Chairs,

The point I wanted to make is that this is not yet another boundary paper. It would be silly for me to claim no one should have any confusion on the paper. But the evidence of bad reviews is strong, as I elaborated in my letter and emails. 

I'd like to request the meta-reviewer (you in this case) and the PC chairs read the paper and decide on whether the negative reviews should be overridden. I know that is asking for a lot of time from all of you, and we will all be grateful. 

I have no right to expect a flawless conference, but I believe actions should be taken on known cases of bad reviews. Hopefully I have now convinced you this paper is one such case. Should you decide to inspect other papers for possible similar cases, I believe many in the community will welcome it and be thankful. I am not in the PC this time. But if I can help on anything, I am more than happy to assist you. 

Thank you very much for your time!

Best regards,
Chengkai
