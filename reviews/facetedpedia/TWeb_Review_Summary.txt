* What's derived is not facet.
* facets are not useful
* evaluation is not rigorous and appropriate.
* evaluation is on structure, but not understandability and usefulness of facets
* fairer comparison with other systems.
* queries are proper nouns.
* input is small collections of documents
* new materials not enough. should extend to new domain
* more accurate description of related work: Stoica and Hearst, Findex, Tunkelang, ....
* I don't buy the argument that facets can't be generated for documents.  I do agree it's a hard problem and would like to see advances on how to do it.  Stoica et al did make headway on this.

The algorithm focuses on coverage and shortness of navigation path rather than on faceted combinations or understandability of facets.  The algorithm is run against small collections of documents on queries consisting primarily of terms that specify a set of proper nouns as their results.  In fact, the authors state that "an inteface should not include two facets that overlap much, which is not a principle of standard faceted interfaces" whose goal is to provide multiple navigation paths to the same results, allowing users to select which of many dimensions they wish to chose first.

(1) The first reviewer noted that as currently designed, the facets obtained are not useful for browsing. This reviewer points out that the categories obtained are not really faceted, and recommends improvements to the algorithm to improve the results.

(2) A second reviewer questions the amount of new material in this submission versus the previously published work.  Although this person feels that transfer to a new domain can warrant enough of an expansion of the work, the authors did not explore this use of their algorithm thoroughly enough.

I have two fundamental objections to this paper as written.  The first is the claim that the results derived are faceted and the second is that the evaluation is not rigorous and appropriate enough for publication in TWEB. 

In more detail, first, the authors claim to derive faceted categories, but they do not do so.  Rather, they traverse available structures (from Wikipedia in this case) to extract subsets.  This would be terrific if it yielded good results, but in my view it does not, and the evaluation done did not assess the quality of the facets obtained.  For a journal article the authors should consider evaluation techniques like those used in Stoica and Hearst for assessing the quality of the resulting categories.  This includes assessing the hierarchical aspects and the logical structure.  

I also feel that the evaluation is flawed for several reasons:
