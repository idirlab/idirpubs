Given the set of Wikipedia articles resulting from a keyword query, Facetedpedia discovers a faceted interface for navigating the result articles. To the best of our knowledge, Facetedpedia is the first such system for Wikipedia. Compared with other faceted retrieval systems, Facetedpedia is fully automatic and dynamic in both facets discovery and hierarchy construction, and the facets are based on rich semantic information in articles. The essence of our approach is to build upon the collaborative vocabulary in Wikipedia, more specifically the intensive structures (hyperlinks) and folksonomy (category system). Given the sheer size and complexity of Wikipedia, the space of possible choices of faceted interfaces is prohibitively large. We propose metrics for ranking individual facet hierarchies by users' navigational costs in reaching the target articles, and metrics for ranking interfaces (each with k facets) by both their average pairwise similarities and average navigational costs. We design facets discovery algorithms to generate faceted interfaces for the target articles, optimizing the ranking metrics. Our experimental evaluation and user study verify the effectiveness of our methods in generating useful faceted interfaces.</td></tr>   <tr><td class="left">Time:</td> <td colspan="5">Aug 14, 08:20 GMT</td></tr>    <tr><td class="authors" colspan="6">Authors</td></tr> <tr><td class="left" rowspan="8">Authors:</td></tr> <tr><td align="center">Name</td> <td align="center">Email</td> <td align="center">Country</td> <td align="center">Affiliation</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td><a target="_top" href="http://ranger.uta.edu/~cli">Chengkai Li</a></td> <td>cli@uta.edu</td> <td>United States</td> <td>University of Texas at Arlington</td> <td><img src="/images/tick.png" /></td></tr> <tr><td>Ning Yan</td> <td>ning.yan.seu@gmail.com</td> <td>United States</td> <td>University of Texas at Arlington</td> <td><img src="/images/tick.png" /></td></tr> <tr><td>Senjuti Basu Roy</td> <td>senjuti.basuroy@mavs.uta.edu</td> <td>United States</td> <td>The University of Texas at Arlington</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>Lekhendro Lisham</td> <td>lisham.singh@mavs.uta.edu</td> <td>United States</td> <td>The University of Texas at Arlington</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td>Gautam Das</td> <td>gdas@cse.uta.edu</td> <td>United States</td> <td>University of Texas at Arlington, USA</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr><td align="right" style="font-size:smaller;color:#777777" colspan="5"><i>Note: the rightmost column marks corresponding authors</i></td></tr></table><h3>Reviews</h3><table class="review" border="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="label" colspan="2">Review  1 </td></tr>    <tr><td class="left">Overall rating: </td> <td><b>1</b>  (weak accept)</td></tr> <tr><td class="left"><b>Confidence: </b></td> <td><b>2</b>  (medium)</td></tr> <tr><td>Relevance to WSDM</td> <td>3 (Relevant)</td></tr><tr><td>Significance and Novelty</td> <td>4 (high)</td></tr><tr><td>Technical Depth and Soundness</td> <td>3 (Medium)</td></tr><tr><td>Clarity of Presentation</td> <td>5 (Easy to read)</td></tr><tr><td>Should the Paper be Considered for the Best Paper Award?</td> <td>2 (May be)</td></tr> <tr><td class="left">Review: </td> <td class="text">1.

It would be ideal if you attempted to conduct a principled study<br/>of the problem of facet selection in graphs or hypergraphs like wikipedia.

Even aiming<br/>to define optimality notions for this problem would be a good contribution.</td></tr>   </table><table class="review" border="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="label" colspan="2">Review  2 </td></tr>    <tr><td class="left">Overall rating: </td> <td><b>-1</b>  (weak reject)</td></tr> <tr><td class="left"><b>Confidence: </b></td> <td><b>4</b>  (expert)</td></tr> <tr><td>Relevance to WSDM</td> <td>3 (Relevant)</td></tr><tr><td>Significance and Novelty</td> <td>2 (Marginal)</td></tr><tr><td>Technical Depth and Soundness</td> <td>3 (Medium)</td></tr><tr><td>Clarity of Presentation</td> <td>4 (Understandable by most readers)</td></tr><tr><td>Should the Paper be Considered for the Best Paper Award?</td> <td>1 (No)</td></tr> <tr><td class="left">Review: </td> <td class="text">1. A Brief Summary of the Main Contributions of the Paper<br/><br/>The paper extracts Wikipedia categories, and rearranges them into a (reduced) facetted hierarchy that enables users to explore all found results rather than wade down a result list one-by-one.<br/><br/>2. Strong Points of the Paper<br/><br/>The idea of exploiting the information in the Wikipedia category structure has great appeal and clear practical importance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many researchers have discovered this source -- so it's not strikingly novel -- but the exact application seems new.<br/><br/>The paper is clearly written in its goals, the used data, and the methods.<br/><br/>3. Weak Points of the Paper <br/><br/>Facetted classifications have existed for some 80 years (with notable early&nbsp;&nbsp;proponents as Ranganathan and Bliss) in library science.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a broad range of theory and practice in developing, using and evaluating such systems, which is completely ignored in this paper.<br/><br/>The build system is relatively clear -- and this is an obvious achievement -- however the main research problem addressed is much less clear, as is the evidence provided for the contribution of the new methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation is limited and compare to a baseline that is -- admittedly -- not suitable for the data at hand.<br/><br/><br/>4. Detailed Comments to Authors<br/><br/>p.7 -- If Castanet is unsuitable for the used data, then why is it a meaningful baseline for the evaluation?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>p.7 -- Clearly, the algorithms used are closely related to the exact user interface (limiting how much information can be displayed, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that Facetedpedia is 'tuned' to fit the intended interface, how can Castanet obtain the same level of 'tuning.'<br/><br/>p.7 -- Please give averages over all queries in Figure (Table?) 11.</td></tr>   </table><table class="review" border="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="label" colspan="2">Review  3 </td></tr>    <tr><td class="left">Overall rating: </td> <td><b>1</b>  (weak accept)</td></tr> <tr><td class="left"><b>Confidence: </b></td> <td><b>1</b>  (low)</td></tr> <tr><td>Relevance to WSDM</td> <td>3 (Relevant)</td></tr><tr><td>Significance and Novelty</td> <td>4 (high)</td></tr><tr><td>Technical Depth and Soundness</td> <td>4 (Generally solid work)</td></tr><tr><td>Clarity of Presentation</td> <td>3 (Readable - but requires some effort)</td></tr><tr><td>Should the Paper be Considered for the Best Paper Award?</td> <td>1 (No)</td></tr> <tr><td class="left">Review: </td> <td class="text">1. A Brief Summary of the Main Contributions of the Paper<br/><br/>The authors describe a method for discovering and ranking facets in Wikipedia. Their system exploits Wikipedia category structure and article links. An article is represented by its out-links, which can be reached by different paths in the category DAG; sub-trees of this DAG are facets for the original set of articles.<br/><br/>2. Strong Points of the Paper<br/><br/>The problem is well motivated and described. Computational issues of the solution are addressed leading to a solution that seems to have in practice linear cost on the number of articles.<br/><br/>3. Weak Points of the Paper <br/><br/>During the user study the users knew the identity of both systems [Choices for R3 where Facetpedia and Castanet according to Figure 10]; this compromises the results of the user study in my opinion.<br/><br/>4. Detailed Comments to Authors<br/><br/>Section 2 could be improved by stressing more the differences and similarities with Castanet.<br/><br/>Presentation of the algorithms is a bit confusing at times, providing too much detail too early on the paper for my taste.<br/><br/>Perhaps a probabilistic interpretation of Definition 6 would be easier to grasp by readers (the second term of eq 1 seems to be proportional to -log of the probability of reaching p' by doing a random walk starting at c1 ?).<br/><br/>Probably you experimented initially without attribute articles, directly with the categories of articles themselves? It would be interesting to know the results, particularly if they were poor.</td></tr>   </table><table class="review" border="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td class="label" colspan="2">Review  4 </td></tr>    <tr><td class="left">Overall rating: </td> <td><b>-1</b>  (weak reject)</td></tr> <tr><td class="left"><b>Confidence: </b></td> <td><b>3</b>  (high)</td></tr> <tr><td>Relevance to WSDM</td> <td>3 (Relevant)</td></tr><tr><td>Significance and Novelty</td> <td>3 (Medium)</td></tr><tr><td>Technical Depth and Soundness</td> <td>3 (Medium)</td></tr><tr><td>Clarity of Presentation</td> <td>4 (Understandable by most readers)</td></tr><tr><td>Should the Paper be Considered for the Best Paper Award?</td> <td>1 (No)</td></tr> <tr><td class="left">Review: </td> <td class="text">1. A Brief Summary of the Main Contributions of the Paper<br/><br/>This paper presents a system that dynamically generates a<br/>query-specific facet interface for wikipedia.&nbsp;&nbsp;All aspects of an<br/>end-to-end system are considered, and solutions are described in<br/>detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a user studying involving 36 people, uers preferred<br/>the system to a baseline system.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2. Strong Points of the Paper<br/><br/>The paper is clearly written and thorough.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to know<br/>whether a reader could exactly reproduce such a complex system, but<br/>the authors have attempted to cover everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nice to see<br/>a user study involving more than 30 users.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>3. Weak Points of the Paper <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the user study is also the paper's weakness.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are<br/>no descriptions or examples of the predefined queries that the users<br/>ran, or the open queries.&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors need to show the types of<br/>information needs; one might expect a faceted system to be a good<br/>match for some information seeking tasks, but not others.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the<br/>absence of such discussion, it is surprising the the faceted system<br/>did so much better than Castanet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Castanet an appropriate<br/>baseline?&nbsp;&nbsp;Google or an ordinary search engine should also have been<br/>included as a baseline.&nbsp;&nbsp;Users should have been timed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Recall a<br/>factor (i.e., find more than 1 result)?&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey reveals which<br/>system is the experimental condition and which was the baseline, so<br/>the evaluation was not blind.<br/><br/>Without a solid evalution, and no examples of the queries or the<br/>results that were produced, it is difficult to know how to evaluate<br/>this work.<br/><br/>This paper would make a good demonstration, so that WSDM participants<br/>could play with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, without a more thorough evaluation, it<br/>is difficult to recommend it for acceptance as a full paper.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>4.
