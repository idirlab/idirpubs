1. Break down each fact. Convert 1 facet into multiple facets.

-- name. collect all leaf (B1) nodes in the facet.

-- if the any node in the facet has title "NOUN by ...", treat  it as one facet.

-- The remaining nodes will stay in the original facet.

2. use 2-level of facets. level 1 is for B1. group level 1 facets. Show the B1's chosen for each group.

3. GUI: highlight the one facet from which a choice has just been made.

4. Combine very small hierarchy. If a hierarchy only covers a very small number of articles (after various nodes have been chosen), make the hierarchy flat.

American_writers>American writers by ethnic or national origin >African American writers [3] >African American songwriters [3] >African American singer-songwriters [3]

We should just combine the last 3 items and shorten it.

5. 

Academy Awards > Academy Award Winners > all people
Academy Awards > Academy Honorary Award Recipients  > all companies

If they have different types, should break down.

6. A similar case is :

Film_production_companies_of_the_United_States>20th Century Fox >20th Century Fox films[2]

However, other leaves under the root are companies. The town under 20th Century Fox films are films. We should just seperate them and first remove them, because they are too small.

or even simpler, Given one facet root, only keep the leaves that are of the majority type?

7. 

Film_production_companies_of_the_United_States > DreamWorks[4] >  {DreamWorks} [4]

8. Shorten the names:

20th_century_television_series_endings>1980s television series endings >1989 television series endings
