ClaimPortal is a web-based platform for monitoring, searching, checking, and analyzing English factual claims on Twitter. ClaimPortal is composed of a front-end web-based GUI, a MySQL database, an Elasticsearch search engine, an API, and several decoupled batch data processing components. The system operates on two layers. The front-end presentation layer allows users to narrow down search results by applying multiple filters. The back-end data collection and computation layer performs collecting tweets, pre-processing of tweets, computing check-worthiness scores of tweets using the public ClaimBuster API, Elasticsearch batch insertion, detecting claim types of tweets, and finding similar fact-checked claims for each tweet, using ClaimBuster API. ClaimPortal stays up-to-date by continuously monitoring newly posted tweets. ClaimPortal at this moment focuses on politically charged tweets. ClaimPortal monitors a curated list of prominent Twitters users in U.S. politics that include house representatives and senators in the Congress, governors, city mayors, U.S. Cabinet members, other government officials, and political teams of news media. 

ClaimPortal's URL is idir.uta.edu/claimportal. Once you navigate to the web page, you will be immediately prompted with a tutorial screen if it is your first time visiting it. The tutorial screen will walk you through ClaimPortal's user interface. On the home page of the ClaimPortal, you can easily customize your search with multiple filters. You can filter tweets based on the keywords entered in the text field. Keyword search on tweets is powered by Elasticsearch engine which is coupled with querying the database to provide additional filters. Also, you can filter tweets by hashtags, claim types, tweet handlers, and user mentions. Tweets can also be further refined by specifying a ClaimBuster score range which correlates how check-worthy a tweet is. The higher the score, the more check-worthy a tweet is. Tweets can also be eliminated based on a specific date range. Finally, you can sort tweets based on the ClaimBuster score or the date. Tweets which meet your search criteria will be displayed on the main page. If you click on an individual tweet, then you will see the ClaimBuster score of that tweet and any known fact-checks that might be related to it. 

ClaimPortal has also an analytics page. It enables web users to explore and analyze factual claims in tweets at scale. For instance, a user can compare tweets from different political groups in detail based on check-worthiness of their claims and variety of their claims.
