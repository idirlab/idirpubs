ClaimPortal is a web-based platform for monitoring, searching, checking, and analyzing English factual claims on Twitter. ClaimPortal continuously collects tweets and monitors factual claims embedded in tweets. It is integrated with fact-checking tools, including a claim matcher which finds known fact-checks matching any given tweet, a claim spotter which scores each claim and the corresponding tweet based on their check-worthiness, i.e., how important it is to fact-check them. ClaimPortal provides an intuitive and convenient search interface that assists its users to sift through these factual claims in tweets using filtering conditions on dates, twitter accounts, content, hashtags, check-worthiness scores, and types of claims. ClaimPortal also provides simple analytics and visualization tools for discovering patterns pertinent to how certain twitter accounts make claims, how different types of claims are distributed, and so on.
